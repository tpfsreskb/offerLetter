          <h2>7. Remuneration, Hours of Work, and Leave</h2>

          <h3>Total Remuneration Package</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>7.1</strong> We operate a Total Remuneration Package system.
            Your Total Remuneration Package is calculated on a combination of
            benefits, salary, and, if applicable, compulsory employer
            superannuation contributions to any KiwiSaver scheme or complying
            superannuation fund to which you belong either at the time you
            commence employment with us, or at any later date. The Total
            Remuneration Package for your position is specified in Schedule 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>7.2</strong> You agree that your Total Remuneration Package
            as specified in Schedule 1 includes all compulsory employer
            contributions to your KiwiSaver or other complying superannuation
            fund account, if applicable. You agree that this clause has been
            negotiated in good faith and complies with section 101B (4) of the
            KiwiSaver Act 2006.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>7.3</strong> Your salary may increase or reduce according to
            what benefits you and we agree you will receive, and whether you are
            or become or cease to be a KiwiSaver or complying superannuation
            fund member.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>7.4</strong> Your salary will be paid monthly via direct
            credit to your nominated bank account, with payments made on the
            last working day of each month. The duties of your position may
            require you to work hours additional to the standard hours of work.
            Your Total Remuneration is in full consideration of the requirements
            of your position in respect of hours and times of employment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>7.5</strong> We will review your Total Remuneration package
            annually. Reviews will not necessarily result in an increase.
          </p>

            <strong>7.6</strong> Please keep the information about your
            remuneration confidential.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>7.7</strong> The duties of your position may require you to
            work hours additional to the standard hours of work. Because your
            position is salaried, no additional payment will be made for those
            additional hours.
          </p>

          <h3>Hours of Work</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>7.8</strong> Your standard hours of work are recorded in

          </p>

          <h3>Deductions</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>7.9</strong> You authorize us to make deductions from your
            wages or holiday pay for any money you owe us and to make a ratable
            deduction from your salary for any time you are absent from work for
            other than periods of authorized paid leave.
          </p>

          <h3>Expenses</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>7.10</strong> We will reimburse you for reasonable business
            expenses specifically authorized by us in writing.
